# Real-Time Face Detection Using OpenCV

## Overview
This project implements **real-time face detection** using **OpenCV** and **Python**. The application captures live video from a webcam and detects faces using a **Haar Cascade Classifier**, drawing bounding boxes around detected faces in real time.
